*  These 17 lines of text are comments. They are not part of the program; 
*  they serve to remind us about its properties. The first two lines tell 
*  us what to type to compile and test the program. The next line describes 
*  the purpose of the program. The next few lines give a sample execution 
*  of the program and the resulting output. We will always include such 
*  lines in our programs and encourage you to do the same.
